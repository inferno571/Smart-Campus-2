# 🚀 Project Title

Smart Campus - A plug and play solution for schools and colleges

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Problem Statement 11- Design a Smart Campus Infrastructure Toolkit
---

## 🎯 Objective

Modern educational institutions often face inefficiencies in managing critical campus operations like room booking, attendance tracking, energy monitoring, and safety alerts. These fragmented systems lead to administrative overhead, security risks, and poor user experiences for students and staff.

## ✅ What Our Project Solves

The Smart Campus Toolkit is an all-in-one platform that streamlines campus operations using AI, blockchain, and real-time data streaming. It offers:

✅ Attendance System: AI-powered facial recognition using Groq and Screenpipe for secure, automated check-ins.

📅 Room Booking: Decentralized booking via Monad blockchain to prevent conflicts and ensure transparency.

🚨 Safety Alerts: Real-time emergency notifications through Fluvio streaming.

⚡ Energy Dashboard: Monitor and optimize energy usage with Groq analytics.

📊 Campus Dashboard: Centralized insights and analytics for administrators.

🏢 Resource Management: Manage physical resources efficiently and transparently.

## 🎯 Who It Serves
The toolkit is designed for universities and colleges, specifically serving:

👨‍🎓 Students – to easily access rooms, stay safe, and get real-time campus updates.

👩‍🏫 Faculty – to manage classes, track attendance, and book resources smoothly.

🏫 Admins – to oversee campus operations from a single, intelligent dashboard.

💡 Value Proposition
This unified platform reduces manual effort, boosts operational efficiency, enhances safety, and builds trust with immutable blockchain records — all while being scalable and modular for any campus.

### Team Members:  
- Saksham Sooden ([GitHub ](https://github.com/inferno571)/ Full-Stack Web Developer)


## 💡 Your Approach:
### Why you chose this problem
Campus operations are often bogged down by inefficient legacy systems that don't talk to each other. We wanted to build a unified platform that brings together attendance, safety, booking, energy, and resource management—making campus life smoother for students, faculty, and staff.

### Key challenges you addressed

- Preventing double bookings using immutable blockchain logic.

- Ensuring real-time responsiveness for safety alerts and dashboards.

- Integrating diverse tools like Groq, Monad, and Fluvio in a cohesive UX.

- Building trust in the system with transparent smart contract workflows.

### Pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking
Initially, we focused only on room booking, but during brainstorming, we realized the same model could be extended to multiple campus functions. Adding modular features like safety alerts and energy dashboards made the toolkit more powerful and extensible.
